# **Hi there, I'm [Kevin Langley Jr!](https://kevinlangleyjr.dev) ðŸ‘‹**

<br />

I am a passionate software engineer living in Central Florida with my beautiful partner, Katie, our four amazing children (Kevin, Xander, Kately, and Finley), and our pupper, d00d.

- ðŸ’¼ &nbsp;&nbsp;Iâ€™m currently employed by [Human Made](https://humanmade.com) as a Principal Web Engineer, where I help create bespoke applications for some amazing clients.
- ðŸ”¥ &nbsp;&nbsp;On the side, I can be found working on my side project, [Scrum.to](https://app.scrum.to), a planning poker scrum tool which connects to your GitHub repositories and makes estimation sessions a breeze.
- ðŸŽ‰ &nbsp;&nbsp;Or contributing to [Blitz.js](https://blitzjs.com) as an L1 Maintainer and big fan!
